# Medlink
A platform where users can search for specialist hospitals and pharmacies getting access to their full details.

#### Problem Statement/Purpose
In Africa, availability of specialist hospitals around neighborhoods and environments is not a rare case but is also not public knowledge. People know there are hospitals around them but do not know the areas of specialization of these hospitals hence they tend to have to circle around different hospitals when they have a special case before they finally find the one that can attend to them. This could lead to further complications or even the worst case of fatality in cases of emergencies.

#### Solution
The Medlink platform was built to solve this problem by connecting users (patients and responders) to specialist hospitals and phamarcies around their vicinity. It is further customized so people can search by location and by categories. It also provides full contact details of these facilities and a map from the user's location to the chosen destination.
